# Genome-wide Association Study in hatching date in the winter moth

This repository contains ongoing work for a **Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS)** focused on identifying genetic factors influencing **hatching date variation** in the winter moth (*Operophtera brumata*).

---

## Project overview

The objective of this study is to uncover genomic regions associated with timing of egg hatching — a key adaptive trait that impacts how winter moth populations respond to environmental changes.  

Analyses include:
- Data preprocessing and quality control  
- Variant calling and filtering  
- Genome-wide association tests  
- Visualisation

## Work in progress

This project is **currently under active development**.  
New scripts, analyses, and reports will be added as progress continues.
